		<h1>Career Goals</h1>
		<ul class="custom-list">
			<li>Complete my B.S. in Information Technology by December 2026</li>
			<li>Continue into an M.S. in IT Management after completing the BSIT</li>
			<li>Build toward $100,000/year in real estate cash flow within 10 years while maintaining a strong IT/cybersecurity career</li>
		</ul>
	</section>


		<h1>Short-Term Goals</h1>

	<section>
		<p>
			In the short term, my goal is to secure a full-time role in IT or cybersecurity where I can contribute immediately in vulnerability management, security operations, and endpoint defense. I want to work in an environment that values reliable fundamentals, clear documentation, and strong execution. I bring hands-on experience performing vulnerability scans, prioritizing remediation, validating fixes, and supporting investigations using tools like Tenable and Microsoft security platforms. I also automate repeatable tasks with PowerShell to improve consistency and reduce time spent on manual work.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Medium-Term Goals</h1>
		<p>
			In the medium term, I plan to grow into a cybersecurity analyst or cloud security role focused on detection, response, and hardening. I want to deepen my skills in threat hunting, log analysis, and building practical detections that improve visibility and reduce risk. I also plan to strengthen my cloud security capabilities in Azure and AWS by learning how secure configurations, identity controls, and monitoring come together in real environments. My goal is to become the person teams rely on to take ownership of problems, communicate clearly, and drive issues to closure.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Long-Term Goals</h1>
		<p>
			Long term, I want to step into a leadership role such as security team lead, cybersecurity manager, or IT security director. My focus will be building strong processes, mentoring junior team members, and improving operational security outcomes through repeatable workflows and measurable results. I bring a leadership background from the U.S. Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment, where performance, accountability, and teamwork mattered every day. I want to apply that same standard to building high-performing teams that protect systems, support users, and keep organizations resilient.
