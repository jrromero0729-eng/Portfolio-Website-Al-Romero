				I am an IT and cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in systems, networking, and security operations. I completed my <strong>B.S. in Information Technology</strong> in December 2025 and I am currently pursuing my <strong>M.S. in IT Management</strong> with an expected completion date of August 2026. I bring hands-on experience supporting real-world environments through vulnerability management, incident triage, and practical automation, along with a consistent focus on secure, reliable IT fundamentals.

				In my current role as a Cybersecurity Support Analyst (Intern) at LOG(N) Pacific, I conduct vulnerability assessments using Tenable, help prioritize and track remediation efforts, and validate fixes after changes are applied. I also automate repeatable tasks with PowerShell, support endpoint investigations, and use Microsoft Sentinel (KQL) and Defender to help review alerts, hunt for suspicious activity, and document findings clearly for follow-on action.

				I hold CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+, along with AWS Cloud Practitioner and ITIL Foundation. These certifications reflect my ability to work across core IT support, networking concepts, security fundamentals, and cloud basics. I’m comfortable collaborating with technical and non-technical stakeholders, writing clear documentation, and following structured processes to reduce risk and improve reliability.

				I also bring over four years of leadership experience from the U.S. Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment, where I worked in high-tempo environments and supported mission-critical operations. That background strengthened my discipline, attention to detail, and ability to execute under pressure while still communicating clearly and working as part of a team.

				I am seeking an opportunity where I can contribute immediately in IT support, security operations, vulnerability management, or junior detection and response work, while continuing to grow technically. I would welcome the chance to share examples of my projects and discuss how I can support your team’s goals.

				Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to connect.
