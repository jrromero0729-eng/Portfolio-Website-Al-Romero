				I am excited to apply for the IT Apprentice position at <em>Aflac</em>. With a strong academic foundation in Information Technology <strong>(B.S. Information Technology, M.S. IT Management in progress)</strong> and hands-on experience as a Cybersecurity Support Analyst intern, I am eager to contribute my technical skills and leadership background to Aflac’s Digital Services team.

				In my current role at LOG(N) Pacific, I perform vulnerability assessments using Tenable, automate remediation with PowerShell, and implement secure cloud configurations in Microsoft Azure. I have developed dashboards in Microsoft Sentinel and conducted proactive threat hunting to reduce incidents, experiences that align with Aflac’s focus on cloud computing, AI, data analytics, and modern IT practices. My certifications, including CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, AWS Cloud Practitioner, and ITIL Foundation, demonstrate a strong technical base and commitment to continuous learning.

				Beyond my technical skills, <mark>I bring over four years of proven leadership from the U.S. Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment</mark>, where I managed logistics for multimillion-dollar assets and led diverse teams under high-pressure conditions. This background instilled in me adaptability, integrity, and a results-driven mindset—qualities I see reflected in Aflac’s values of supporting organizational goals, serving customers, and working with diverse populations.

I am confident that my combination of technical training, professional certifications, and leadership experience positions me to make a meaningful contribution while advancing within your IT division.
